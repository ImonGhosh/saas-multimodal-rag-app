"38","A system predicts likely follow-up questions and pre-fetches documents in the background. Which RAG type is this?","Speculative RAG."
"39","What does Corrective RAG do when it suspects an answer is weak?","It drops weaker sources, performs a new search for more relevant information, and updates the response."
"40","What is Modular RAG?","A toolkit-style RAG where separate modules handle different parts of the process, allowing components like the retriever, reranker, or generator to be swapped without rebuilding the system."
"41","What is Naive RAG and how does it retrieve information?","The simplest form of RAG that converts a question into basic search terms, retrieves top matching documents, and passes them directly to the model without filtering or reranking."
"42","What is Advanced RAG?","A refined RAG approach that combines multiple techniques such as reranking, memory, feedback loops, branching, and improved retrieval to produce more accurate results."
"43","What is HyDE (hypothetical document embedding) and how does it retrieve documents?","It generates a hypothetical answer first, converts it into a search query, and retrieves real documents similar to the imagined answer."
"44","Why are there different types of RAG architectures?","Because no single setup works well in every situation; some tasks need speed and simplicity while others require deeper analysis, multiple sources, or different input types."

"50","In what forms can Docling be used?","It is released as a Python package and can be used as a Python API or as a CLI tool."
"51","Why has converting documents into a unified machine-processable format been challenging?","Because of huge variability in formats, weak standardization, and printing-optimized characteristics that often discard structural features and metadata."
"52","What input formats can Docling parse and what output formats can it export to?","It parses PDF, Images, MS Office formats, and HTML, and exports to Markdown, JSON, and HTML."
"53","Which document-understanding capabilities does Docling apply advanced AI for?","Detailed page layout, OCR, reading order, figure extraction, and table structure recognition."
"54","In the described image/table, what are the two column labels, and according to Figure 1, what do both pipelines build and how can downstream applications use it?","The columns are labeled ""PDF Pipeline"" and ""Build"". Figure 1 says both the PDF pipeline and simple pipeline build a DoclingDocument representation (which can be further enriched), and downstream applications can use Docling's API to inspect, export, or chunk the document."
"55","What are two key challenges of VLM-based conversion tools, and how are they typically offered?","They are prone to hallucinations and require substantial computational resources, making conversion expensive; they are typically offered as SaaS with compute-intensive operations performed in the cloud."
"56","How does Docling ensure faithful conversion and what trade-off does that introduce?","All text content is taken from the programmatic PDF or transcribed through OCR methods to avoid generating false content, but this requires maintaining a diverse set of models for different document components such as formulas or figures."
