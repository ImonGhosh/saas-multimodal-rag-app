1,"According to the article, what does RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) represent?","A way for AI systems to retrieve and use relevant information from external knowledge sources to generate more accurate responses."
2,"How does RAG improve on relying only on training data?","It uses real-time data from documents or databases before generating responses rather than relying only on training data."
3,"What is Simple RAG (original)?","The most basic form of RAG where the system retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base in a single step and uses that information to generate a response."
4,"What is Simple RAG with memory and what does memory mean in this context?","An enhanced version of simple RAG that can remember previous conversations; memory means the system keeps track of past interactions and understands how prior context can influence new searches."
5,"Which RAG type plans its approach like an experienced researcher and continues searching if the first results do not answer the question?","Agentic RAG."
6,"What is Graph RAG?","A RAG approach that uses a knowledge graph to understand how information is connected and finds relationships and patterns rather than just matching words."
7,"What is Self-RAG and how does it improve retrieval?","A RAG type that rewrites the question and checks its own answers; it answers using retrieved data, evaluates accuracy with specialized modules, and rewrites the query with missing context to improve retrieval."
8,"Which RAG type explores multiple interpretations in parallel and compares the results before choosing an answer?","Branched RAG."
9,"What is Multimodal RAG?","A RAG approach that uses multiple content types such as text, images, videos, audio, charts, and documents, converting them into a format it can search and understand."
10,"How does Adaptive RAG decide how to retrieve and generate answers?","It recognizes the type of question (simple, complex, broad, or narrow) and adjusts its retrieval process and generation style accordingly."
11,"A system predicts likely follow-up questions and pre-fetches documents in the background. Which RAG type is this?","Speculative RAG."
12,"What does Corrective RAG do when it suspects an answer is weak?","It drops weaker sources, performs a new search for more relevant information, and updates the response."
13,"What is Modular RAG?","A toolkit-style RAG where separate modules handle different parts of the process, allowing components like the retriever, reranker, or generator to be swapped without rebuilding the system."
14,"What is Naive RAG and how does it retrieve information?","The simplest form of RAG that converts a question into basic search terms, retrieves top matching documents, and passes them directly to the model without filtering or reranking."
15,"What is Advanced RAG?","A refined RAG approach that combines multiple techniques such as reranking, memory, feedback loops, branching, and improved retrieval to produce more accurate results."
16,"What is HyDE (hypothetical document embedding) and how does it retrieve documents?","It generates a hypothetical answer first, converts it into a search query, and retrieves real documents similar to the imagined answer."
17,"Why are there different types of RAG architectures?","Because no single setup works well in every situation; some tasks need speed and simplicity while others require deeper analysis, multiple sources, or different input types."
18,"Why is RAG considered important?","It keeps language models grounded in true information rather than hallucinations by combining retrieval with generative AI to produce more relevant and accurate answers."
19,"List the five RAG tools mentioned in the tools section.","Meilisearch, LangChain, Weaviate, Faiss, and Haystack."
20,"According to the Meilisearch section, why is Meilisearch favored for building RAG systems and what capabilities does it have?","It is a lightning-fast, open-source search engine built for speed and can handle typos, partial matches, and complex queries."
