With the advent of LLMs and popular application patterns such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), leveraging the rich content embedded in PDFs, Office documents, and scanned document images has become ever more relevant. In the past decade, several powerful document understanding solutions have emerged on the market, most of which are commercial software, SaaS offerings on hyperscalers (Auer et al. 2022) and most recently, multimodal vision-language models. Typically, they incur a cost (e.g., for licensing or LLM inference) and cannot be run easily on local hardware. Meanwhile, only a handful of different open-source tools cover PDF, MS Word, MS PowerPoint, Images, or HTML conversion, leaving a significant feature and quality gap to proprietary solutions.\n* These authors contributed equally.\nCopyright © 2025, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nWith Docling , we recently open-sourced a very capable and efficient document conversion tool which builds on the powerful, specialized AI models and datasets for layout analysis and table structure recognition that we developed and presented in the recent past (Livathinos et al. 2021; Pfitzmann et al. 2022; Lysak et al. 2023). Docling is designed as a simple, self-contained Python library with permissive MIT license, running entirely locally on commodity hardware. Its code architecture allows for easy extensibility and addition of new features and models. Since its launch in July 2024, Docling has attracted considerable attention in the AI developer community and ranks top on GitHub's monthly trending repositories with more than 10,000 stars at the time of writing. On October 16, 2024, Docling reached a major milestone with version 2, introducing several new features and concepts, which we outline in this updated technical report, along with details on its architecture, conversion speed benchmarks, and comparisons to other open-source assets.\nThe following list summarizes the features currently available on Docling:", '[Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion]\n1 Introduction\n- Parses common document formats (PDF, Images, MS Office formats, HTML) and exports to Markdown, JSON, and HTML.\n- Applies advanced AI for document understanding, including detailed page layout, OCR, reading order, figure extraction, and table structure recognition.\n- Establishes a unified DoclingDocument data model for rich document representation and operations.\n- Provides fully local execution capabilities making it suitable for sensitive data and air-gapped environments.\n- Has an ecosystem of plug-and-play integrations with prominent generative AI development frameworks, including LangChain and LlamaIndex.\n- Can leverage hardware accelerators such as GPUs.', "[Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion]\nAbstract\nWe introduce Docling , an easy-to-use, self-contained, MITlicensed, open-source toolkit for document conversion, that can parse several types of popular document formats into a unified, richly structured representation. It is powered by state-of-the-art specialized AI models for layout analysis (DocLayNet) and table structure recognition (TableFormer), and runs efficiently on commodity hardware in a small resource budget. Docling is released as a Python package and can be used as a Python API or as a CLI tool. Docling's modular architecture and efficient document representation make it easy to implement extensions, new features, models, and customizations. Docling has been already integrated in other popular open-source frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, spaCy), making it a natural fit for the processing of documents and the development of high-end applications. The open-source community has fully engaged in using, promoting, and developing for Docling, which gathered 10k stars on GitHub in less than a month and was reported as the No. 1 trending repository in GitHub worldwide in November 2024.\nRepository -https://github.com/DS4SD/docling"], turns=None, additional_metadata=None), TestResult(name='test_case_17', success=True, metrics_data=[MetricData(name='Contextual Precision', threshold=0.5, success=True, score=1.0, reason="The score is 1.00 because the first node provides a clear and direct answer to the question about compliance-related features, stating that 'All conversational AI implementations must include content filtering, PII detection, and conversation logging for compliance purposes.'

These solutions can be categorized along several key dimensions, including open vs. closed source, permissive vs. restrictive licensing, Web APIs vs. local code deployment, susceptibility\nFigure 1: Sketch of Docling's pipelines and usage model. Both PDF pipeline and simple pipeline build up a DoclingDocument representation, which can be further enriched. Downstream applications can utilize Docling's API to inspect, export, or chunk the document for various purposes.\nto hallucinations, conversion quality, time-to-solution, and compute resource requirements.\nThe most popular conversion tools today leverage visionlanguage models (VLMs), which process page images to text and markup directly. Among proprietary solutions, prominent examples include GPT-4o (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), and Gemini (Google). In the open-source domain, LLaVA-based models, such as LLaVA-next, are noteworthy. However, all generative AI-based models face two significant challenges. First, they are prone to hallucinations, i.e., their output may contain false information which is not present in the source document - a critical issue when faithful transcription of document content is required. Second, these models demand substantial computational resources, making the conversion process expensive. Consequently, VLM-based tools are typically offered as SaaS, with compute-intensive operations performed remotely in the cloud.\nA second category of solutions prioritizes on-premises deployment, either as Web APIs or as libraries. Examples include Adobe Acrobat, Grobid, Marker, MinerU, Unstructured, and others. These solutions often rely on multiple specialized models, such as OCR, layout analysis, and table recognition models. Docling falls into this category, leveraging modular, task-specific models which recover document structures and features only. All text content is taken from the programmatic PDF or transcribed through OCR methods. This design ensures faithful conversion, without the risk of generating false content.

Among proprietary solutions, prominent examples include GPT-4o (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), and Gemini (Google). In the open-source domain, LLaVA-based models, such as LLaVA-next, are noteworthy. However, all generative AI-based models face two significant challenges. First, they are prone to hallucinations, i.e., their output may contain false information which is not present in the source document - a critical issue when faithful transcription of document content is required. Second, these models demand substantial computational resources, making the conversion process expensive.

This grounding in factual data leads to more accurate and reliable outputs.\n\n3. **Adaptability**: RAG systems can adjust their retrieval and generation processes based on the complexity of the query. For instance, they can handle simple questions with straightforward answers or more complex inquiries that require deeper analysis and multiple sources.\n\n4. **Improved Relevance**: RAG can refine its responses by iterating through multiple retrieval and generation steps, which allows for a more nuanced understanding of the query and a better-tailored answer.\n\n5. **Learning from Experience**: Some RAG architectures, like Adaptive RAG, can learn from past interactions, improving their ability to respond to different types of questions over time.\n\nOverall, RAG represents a significant advancement in AI capabilities by combining the strengths of information retrieval with generative models, making it particularly useful in applications where accuracy and relevance are critical, such as customer support and research tools (Source: 14 types of RAG).', expected_output='It uses real-time data from documents or databases before generating responses rather than relying only on training data.', context=None, retrieval_context=['[Source: 14 types of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)]\ning, memory, feedback loops, branching, improved data retrieval, etc.) to get more accurate results.\n![Advanced RAG.png](https://unable-actionable-car.media.strapiapp.com/Advanced_RAG_9b806ab383.png)\nAdvanced RAG works by layering various RAG techniques: it can rewrite the query to make it more straightforward, rank the results, check if the answer makes sense, and even review it if required, all to ensure that the generated response is the most relevant and accurate.\nAdvanced RAG is used in systems when making mistakes is not an option, such as in research tools or enterprise applications.\n**Pros:**\n  * Handles complex questions better\n  * Smart enough to know which approach works best for different situations\n  * Offers more control over how results are generated\n\n\n**Cons:**\n  * Requires expertise to build and keep running properly\n  * Requires careful fine-tuning to ensure all parts work together effectively\n  * Expensive to run due to its background work\n\n\n## 14.', '[Source: 14 types of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)]\nrks and what doesn’t, and gradually improves its ability to respond to different kinds of questions.\n![Adaptive RAG.png](https://unable-actionable-car.media.strapiapp.com/Adaptive_RAG_60242702c1.png)\nAdaptive RAG works by first recognizing the type of question (simple, complex, broad, or narrow) it received, then adjusting its retrieval process and generation style based on the question to provide an accurate answer.\nAdaptive RAG is used in systems that deal with all kinds of queries, such as customer support bots, research tools, and digital assistants.\n**Pros:**\n  * Gets better at helping you over time by learning your preferences\n  * Improves relevance by adjusting to the query type\n  * Can balance speed and depth when required\n\n\n**Cons:**\n  * It takes time to learn and improve, so early results might be inconsistent\n  * More complex to build and maintain than static RAG architectures\n  * Can get stuck in bad habits if it learns from poor examples\n\n\n## 9.

But if you are working on complex research or handling messy data, you might consider something smarter, such as agentic or self-RAG.\nNow, let’s see the importance of RAG.\n## What is the importance of RAG?\n[RAG is a technique](https://www.meilisearch.com/blog/<https:/www.meilisearch.com/blog/rag-techniques>) that combines information retrieval with generative AI. It retrieves documents from a knowledge base and uses them to generate a more relevant and accurate answer.\nIt is important because it helps language models stay grounded in true information rather than hallucinations.\nRAGs are widely used for various real-world use cases.\nTech companies, for instance, use RAG to help support agents quickly find answers to technical issues without going through pages of documentation.', '[Source: 14 types of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)]\nch>)\nIn this article\nRAG (retrieval-augmented generation) represents a way for AI systems to retrieve and use relevant information from external knowledge sources to generate more accurate responses.\nInstead of relying only on training data, RAG uses real-time data (from documents or databases) before generating responses.\nDifferent types of RAG architecture handle various tasks, depending on the level of complexity.\nSome RAG types are simple; they retrieve once and generate an answer.\nOther types require multiple steps (such as retrieving, refining, and re-generating) to improve the quality of their response.\nHere is a table that briefly describes the various RAG types along with their use cases.\n![RAG types.png](https://unable-actionable-car.media.strapiapp.com/RAG_types_0be7d3e99b.png)\n## 1.

It retrieves documents from a knowledge base and uses them to generate a more relevant and accurate answer.\nIt is important because it helps language models stay grounded in true information rather than hallucinations.\nRAGs are widely used for various real-world use cases.\nTech companies, for instance, use RAG to help support agents quickly find answers to technical issues without going through pages of documentation.', '[Source: 14 types of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)]\nch>)\nIn this article\nRAG (retrieval-augmented generation) represents a way for AI systems to retrieve and use relevant information from external knowledge sources to generate more accurate responses.\nInstead of relying only on training data, RAG uses real-time data (from documents or databases) before generating responses.\nDifferent types of RAG architecture handle various tasks, depending on the level of complexity.\nSome RAG types are simple; they retrieve once and generate an answer.\nOther types require multiple steps (such as retrieving, refining, and re-generating) to improve the quality of their response.\nHere is a table that briefly describes the various RAG types along with their use cases.\n![RAG types.png](https://unable-actionable-car.media.strapiapp.com/RAG_types_0be7d3e99b.png)\n## 1.

But if you are working on complex research or handling messy data, you might consider something smarter, such as agentic or self-RAG.\nNow, let’s see the importance of RAG.\n## What is the importance of RAG?\n[RAG is a technique](https://www.meilisearch.com/blog/<https:/www.meilisearch.com/blog/rag-techniques>) that combines information retrieval with generative AI. It retrieves documents from a knowledge base and uses them to generate a more relevant and accurate answer.\nIt is important because it helps language models stay grounded in true information rather than hallucinations.\nRAGs are widely used for various real-world use cases.\nTech companies, for instance, use RAG to help support agents quickly find answers to technical issues without going through pages of documentation.', '[Source: 14 types of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)]\ning, memory, feedback loops, branching, improved data retrieval, etc.) to get more accurate results.\n![Advanced RAG.png](https://unable-actionable-car.media.strapiapp.com/Advanced_RAG_9b806ab383.png)\nAdvanced RAG works by layering various RAG techniques: it can rewrite the query to make it more straightforward, rank the results, check if the answer makes sense, and even review it if required, all to ensure that the generated response is the most relevant and accurate.\nAdvanced RAG is used in systems when making mistakes is not an option, such as in research tools or enterprise applications.\n**Pros:**\n  * Handles complex questions better\n  * Smart enough to know which approach works best for different situations\n  * Offers more control over how results are generated\n\n\n**Cons:**\n  * Requires expertise to build and keep running properly\n  * Requires careful fine-tuning to ensure all parts work together effectively\n  * Expensive to run due to its background work\n\n\n## 14.', '[Source: 14 types of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)]\na8d.png&w=3840&q=75)\nShare the article\n[](https://www.meilisearch.com/blog/<https:/github.com/meilisearch>)[](https://www.meilisearch.com/blog/<https:/twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://meilisearch.com/blog/rag-types&text=@meilisearch 14 types of RAG \\(Retrieval-Augmented Generation\\)>)[](https://www.meilisearch.com/blog/<https:/www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://meilisearch.com/blog/rag-types&text=14 types of RAG \\(Retrieval-Augmented Generation\\)>)[](https://www.meilisearch.com/blog/<https:/www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://meilisearch.com/blog/rag-types&title=14 types of RAG \\(Retrieval-Augmented Generation\\)&selftext=Discover 14 types of RAG \\(Retrieval-Augmented Generation\\), their uses, pros and cons, and more.>)\nIn this article\n[1.

retrieval and generation of answers by dynamically adjusting its methods based on the type of question it receives. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. **Question Recognition**: Adaptive RAG first identifies the nature of the question—whether it is simple, complex, broad, or narrow. This classification helps in determining the appropriate retrieval strategy.\n\n2. **Dynamic Retrieval Process**: Based on the recognized question type, Adaptive RAG modifies its retrieval process. For instance, it may choose to retrieve multiple sources of information for complex questions or focus on a single source for straightforward queries.\n\n3. **Answer Generation**: After retrieving the relevant information, Adaptive RAG generates an answer that is tailored to the specific context of the question. This may involve refining the retrieved data or synthesizing information from multiple sources.\n\n4. **Learning Over Time**: One of the key advantages of Adaptive RAG is its ability to learn from interactions. It improves its performance by adapting to user preferences and the types of queries it encounters, which enhances the relevance and accuracy of its responses over time.\n\n### Pros and Cons\n- **Pros**:\n  - Learns and improves with use, enhancing user experience.\n  - Adjusts retrieval and generation strategies based on query complexity.\n  - Balances speed and depth of responses.\n\n- **Cons**:\n  - Initial results may be inconsistent as it learns.\n  - More complex to implement and maintain compared to static RAG systems.\n  - Risk of developing biases if it learns from poor examples.\n\nAdaptive RAG is particularly useful in applications like customer support bots, research tools, and digital assistants, where a wide variety of queries are expected (Source: 14 types of RAG).', expected_output='It recognizes the type of question (simple, complex, broad, or narrow) and adjusts its retrieval process and generation style accordingly.', context=None, retrieval_context=['[Source: 14 types of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)]\nch>)\nIn this article\nRAG (retrieval-augmented generation) represents a way for AI systems to retrieve and use relevant information from external knowledge sources to generate more accurate responses.\nInstead of relying only on training data, RAG uses real-time data (from documents or databases) before generating responses.\nDifferent types of RAG architecture handle various tasks, depending on the level of complexity.\nSome RAG types are simple; they retrieve once and generate an answer.\nOther types require multiple steps (such as retrieving, refining, and re-generating) to improve the quality of their response.\nHere is a table that briefly describes the various RAG types along with their use cases.\n![RAG types.png](https://unable-actionable-car.media.strapiapp.com/RAG_types_0be7d3e99b.png)\n## 1.

It retrieves documents from a knowledge base and uses them to generate a more relevant and accurate answer.\nIt is important because it helps language models stay grounded in true information rather than hallucinations.\nRAGs are widely used for various real-world use cases.\nTech companies, for instance, use RAG to help support agents quickly find answers to technical issues without going through pages of documentation.', '[Source: 14 types of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)]\ning, memory, feedback loops, branching, improved data retrieval, etc.) to get more accurate results.\n![Advanced RAG.png](https://unable-actionable-car.media.strapiapp.com/Advanced_RAG_9b806ab383.png)\nAdvanced RAG works by layering various RAG techniques: it can rewrite the query to make it more straightforward, rank the results, check if the answer makes sense, and even review it if required, all to ensure that the generated response is the most relevant and accurate.\nAdvanced RAG is used in systems when making mistakes is not an option, such as in research tools or enterprise applications.\n**Pros:**\n  * Handles complex questions better\n  * Smart enough to know which approach works best for different situations\n  * Offers more control over how results are generated\n\n\n**Cons:**\n  * Requires expertise to build and keep running properly\n  * Requires careful fine-tuning to ensure all parts work together effectively\n  * Expensive to run due to its background work\n\n\n## 14.', '[Source: 14 types of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)]\n.

With the advent of LLMs and popular application patterns such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), leveraging the rich content embedded in PDFs, Office documents, and scanned document images has become ever more relevant. In the past decade, several powerful document understanding solutions have emerged on the market, most of which are commercial software, SaaS offerings on hyperscalers (Auer et al. 2022) and most recently, multimodal vision-language models. Typically, they incur a cost (e.g., for licensing or LLM inference) and cannot be run easily on local hardware. Meanwhile, only a handful of different open-source tools cover PDF, MS Word, MS PowerPoint, Images, or HTML conversion, leaving a significant feature and quality gap to proprietary solutions.\n* These authors contributed equally.\nCopyright © 2025, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nWith Docling , we recently open-sourced a very capable and efficient document conversion tool which builds on the powerful, specialized AI models and datasets for layout analysis and table structure recognition that we developed and presented in the recent past (Livathinos et al. 2021; Pfitzmann et al. 2022; Lysak et al. 2023). Docling is designed as a simple, self-contained Python library with permissive MIT license, running entirely locally on commodity hardware. Its code architecture allows for easy extensibility and addition of new features and models. Since its launch in July 2024, Docling has attracted considerable attention in the AI developer community and ranks top on GitHub's monthly trending repositories with more than 10,000 stars at the time of writing. On October 16, 2024, Docling reached a major milestone with version 2, introducing several new features and concepts, which we outline in this updated technical report, along with details on its architecture, conversion speed benchmarks, and comparisons to other open-source assets.\nThe following list summarizes the features currently available on Docling:", '[Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion]\n3 Design and Architecture\nDocling is designed in a modular fashion with extensibility in mind, and it builds on three main concepts: pipelines, parser backends, and the DoclingDocument data model as its centerpiece (see Figure 1). Pipelines and parser backends share the responsibility of constructing and enriching a DoclingDocument representation from any supported input format. The DoclingDocument data model with its APIs enable inspection, export, and downstream processing for various applications, such as RAG.', "[Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion]\n2 State of the Art\nDocument conversion is a well-established field with numerous solutions already available on the market. These solutions can be categorized along several key dimensions, including open vs. closed source, permissive vs. restrictive licensing, Web APIs vs. local code deployment, susceptibility\nFigure 1: Sketch of Docling's pipelines and usage model. Both PDF pipeline and simple pipeline build up a DoclingDocument representation, which can be further enriched. Downstream applications can utilize Docling's API to inspect, export, or chunk the document for various purposes.\nto hallucinations, conversion quality, time-to-solution, and compute resource requirements.\nThe most popular conversion tools today leverage visionlanguage models (VLMs), which process page images to text and markup directly. Among proprietary solutions, prominent examples include GPT-4o (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), and Gemini (Google). In the open-source domain, LLaVA-based models, such as LLaVA-next, are noteworthy. However, all generative AI-based models face two significant challenges.

Downstream applications can utilize Docling's API to inspect, export, or chunk the document for various purposes.\nto hallucinations, conversion quality, time-to-solution, and compute resource requirements.\nThe most popular conversion tools today leverage visionlanguage models (VLMs), which process page images to text and markup directly. Among proprietary solutions, prominent examples include GPT-4o (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), and Gemini (Google). In the open-source domain, LLaVA-based models, such as LLaVA-next, are noteworthy. However, all generative AI-based models face two significant challenges. First, they are prone to hallucinations, i.e., their output may contain false information which is not present in the source document - a critical issue when faithful transcription of document content is required. Second, these models demand substantial computational resources, making the conversion process expensive. Consequently, VLM-based tools are typically offered as SaaS, with compute-intensive operations performed remotely in the cloud.\nA second category of solutions prioritizes on-premises deployment, either as Web APIs or as libraries. Examples include Adobe Acrobat, Grobid, Marker, MinerU, Unstructured, and others. These solutions often rely on multiple specialized models, such as OCR, layout analysis, and table recognition models. Docling falls into this category, leveraging modular, task-specific models which recover document structures and features only. All text content is taken from the programmatic PDF or transcribed through OCR methods. This design ensures faithful conversion, without the risk of generating false content. However, it necessitates maintaining a diverse set of models for different document components, such as formulas or figures.", "[Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion]\n1 Introduction\nConverting documents back into a unified machineprocessable format has been a major challenge for decades due to their huge variability in formats, weak standardization and printing-optimized characteristic, which often discards structural features and metadata. With the advent of LLMs and popular application patterns such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), leveraging the rich content embedded in PDFs, Office documents, and scanned document images has become ever more relevant. In the past decade, several powerful document understanding solutions have emerged on the market, most of which are commercial software, SaaS offerings on hyperscalers (Auer et al. 2022) and most recently, multimodal vision-language models. Typically, they incur a cost (e.g., for licensing or LLM inference) and cannot be run easily on local hardware. Meanwhile, only a handful of different open-source tools cover PDF, MS Word, MS PowerPoint, Images, or HTML conversion, leaving a significant feature and quality gap to proprietary solutions.\n* These authors contributed equally.\nCopyright © 2025, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nWith Docling , we recently open-sourced a very capable and efficient document conversion tool which builds on the powerful, specialized AI models and datasets for layout analysis and table structure recognition that we developed and presented in the recent past (Livathinos et al. 2021; Pfitzmann et al. 2022; Lysak et al. 2023). Docling is designed as a simple, self-contained Python library with permissive MIT license, running entirely locally on commodity hardware. Its code architecture allows for easy extensibility and addition of new features and models. Since its launch in July 2024, Docling has attracted considerable attention in the AI developer community and ranks top on GitHub's monthly trending repositories with more than 10,000 stars at the time of writing. On October 16, 2024, Docling reached a major milestone with version 2, introducing several new features and concepts, which we outline in this updated technical report, along with details on its architecture, conversion speed benchmarks, and comparisons to other open-source assets.\nThe following list summarizes the features currently available on Docling:", '[Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion]\nDocling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion\nNikolaos Livathinos * , Christoph Auer * , Maksym Lysak, Ahmed Nassar, Michele Dolfi, Panagiotis Vagenas, Cesar Berrospi, Matteo Omenetti, Kasper Dinkla, Yusik Kim, Shubham Gupta, Rafael Teixeira de Lima, Valery Weber, Lucas Morin, Ingmar Meijer, Viktor Kuropiatnyk, Peter W.

It is powered by state-of-the-art specialized AI models for layout analysis (DocLayNet) and table structure recognition (TableFormer), and runs efficiently on commodity hardware in a small resource budget. Docling is released as a Python package and can be used as a Python API or as a CLI tool. Docling's modular architecture and efficient document representation make it easy to implement extensions, new features, models, and customizations. Docling has been already integrated in other popular open-source frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, spaCy), making it a natural fit for the processing of documents and the development of high-end applications.

Docling's modular architecture and efficient document representation make it easy to implement extensions, new features, models, and customizations. Docling has been already integrated in other popular open-source frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, spaCy), making it a natural fit for the processing of documents and the development of high-end applications. The open-source community has fully engaged in using, promoting, and developing for Docling, which gathered 10k stars on GitHub in less than a month and was reported as the No. 1 trending repository in GitHub worldwide in November 2024.\nRepository -https://github.com/DS4SD/docling", '[Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion]\n3.1 Docling Document\nDocling v2 introduces a unified document representation, DoclingDocument , as a Pydantic data model that can express various common document features, such as:\n- Text, Tables, Pictures, Captions, Lists, and more.\n- Document hierarchy with sections and groups.\n- Disambiguation between main body and headers, footers (furniture).\n- Layout information (i.e., bounding boxes) for all items, if available.\n- Provenance information (i.e., page numbers, document origin).', "[Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion]\n1 Introduction\nConverting documents back into a unified machineprocessable format has been a major challenge for decades due to their huge variability in formats, weak standardization and printing-optimized characteristic, which often discards structural features and metadata.

In the past decade, several powerful document understanding solutions have emerged on the market, most of which are commercial software, SaaS offerings on hyperscalers (Auer et al. 2022) and most recently, multimodal vision-language models. Typically, they incur a cost (e.g., for licensing or LLM inference) and cannot be run easily on local hardware.

Pipelines and parser backends share the responsibility of constructing and enriching a DoclingDocument representation from any supported input format. The DoclingDocument data model with its APIs enable inspection, export, and downstream processing for various applications, such as RAG.', "[Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion]\n2 State of the Art\nDocument conversion is a well-established field with numerous solutions already available on the market. These solutions can be categorized along several key dimensions, including open vs. closed source, permissive vs. restrictive licensing, Web APIs vs. local code deployment, susceptibility\nFigure 1: Sketch of Docling's pipelines and usage model. Both PDF pipeline and simple pipeline build up a DoclingDocument representation, which can be further enriched. Downstream applications can utilize Docling's API to inspect, export, or chunk the document for various purposes.\nto hallucinations, conversion quality, time-to-solution, and compute resource requirements.\nThe most popular conversion tools today leverage visionlanguage models (VLMs), which process page images to text and markup directly. Among proprietary solutions, prominent examples include GPT-4o (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), and Gemini (Google). In the open-source domain, LLaVA-based models, such as LLaVA-next, are noteworthy. However, all generative AI-based models face two significant challenges. First, they are prone to hallucinations, i.e., their output may contain false information which is not present in the source document - a critical issue when faithful transcription of document content is required. Second, these models demand substantial computational resources, making the conversion process expensive. Consequently, VLM-based tools are typically offered as SaaS, with compute-intensive operations performed remotely in the cloud.\nA second category of solutions prioritizes on-premises deployment, either as Web APIs or as libraries. Examples include Adobe Acrobat, Grobid, Marker, MinerU, Unstructured, and others. These solutions often rely on multiple specialized models, such as OCR, layout analysis, and table recognition models. Docling falls into this category, leveraging modular, task-specific models which recover document structures and features only. All text content is taken from the programmatic PDF or transcribed through OCR methods. This design ensures faithful conversion, without the risk of generating false content.

Among proprietary solutions, prominent examples include GPT-4o (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), and Gemini (Google). In the open-source domain, LLaVA-based models, such as LLaVA-next, are noteworthy. However, all generative AI-based models face two significant challenges. First, they are prone to hallucinations, i.e., their output may contain false information which is not present in the source document - a critical issue when faithful transcription of document content is required. Second, these models demand substantial computational resources, making the conversion process expensive. Consequently, VLM-based tools are typically offered as SaaS, with compute-intensive operations performed remotely in the cloud.\nA second category of solutions prioritizes on-premises deployment, either as Web APIs or as libraries. Examples include Adobe Acrobat, Grobid, Marker, MinerU, Unstructured, and others. These solutions often rely on multiple specialized models, such as OCR, layout analysis, and table recognition models. Docling falls into this category, leveraging modular, task-specific models which recover document structures and features only. All text content is taken from the programmatic PDF or transcribed through OCR methods. This design ensures faithful conversion, without the risk of generating false content. However, it necessitates maintaining a diverse set of models for different document components, such as formulas or figures.", "[Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion]\n1 Introduction\nConverting documents back into a unified machineprocessable format has been a major challenge for decades due to their huge variability in formats, weak standardization and printing-optimized characteristic, which often discards structural features and metadata. With the advent of LLMs and popular application patterns such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), leveraging the rich content embedded in PDFs, Office documents, and scanned document images has become ever more relevant. In the past decade, several powerful document understanding solutions have emerged on the market, most of which are commercial software, SaaS offerings on hyperscalers (Auer et al. 2022) and most recently, multimodal vision-language models. Typically, they incur a cost (e.g., for licensing or LLM inference) and cannot be run easily on local hardware. Meanwhile, only a handful of different open-source tools cover PDF, MS Word, MS PowerPoint, Images, or HTML conversion, leaving a significant feature and quality gap to proprietary solutions.\n* These authors contributed equally.\nCopyright © 2025, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nWith Docling , we recently open-sourced a very capable and efficient document conversion tool which builds on the powerful, specialized AI models and datasets for layout analysis and table structure recognition that we developed and presented in the recent past (Livathinos et al. 2021; Pfitzmann et al. 2022; Lysak et al. 2023). Docling is designed as a simple, self-contained Python library with permissive MIT license, running entirely locally on commodity hardware. Its code architecture allows for easy extensibility and addition of new features and models. Since its launch in July 2024, Docling has attracted considerable attention in the AI developer community and ranks top on GitHub's monthly trending repositories with more than 10,000 stars at the time of writing. On October 16, 2024, Docling reached a major milestone with version 2, introducing several new features and concepts, which we outline in this updated technical report, along with details on its architecture, conversion speed benchmarks, and comparisons to other open-source assets.\nThe following list summarizes the features currently available on Docling:", '[Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion]\nDocling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion\nNikolaos Livathinos * , Christoph Auer * , Maksym Lysak, Ahmed Nassar, Michele Dolfi, Panagiotis Vagenas, Cesar Berrospi, Matteo Omenetti, Kasper Dinkla, Yusik Kim, Shubham Gupta, Rafael Teixeira de Lima, Valery Weber, Lucas Morin, Ingmar Meijer, Viktor Kuropiatnyk, Peter W.

Addi- tionally, Docling offers highly accurate, resource-efficient, and fast models, making it well-suited for integration with many standard frameworks.\nIn summary, Docling stands out as a cost-effective, accurate and transparent open-source library with a permissive license, offering a reliable and flexible solution for document conversion.', "[Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion]\nAbstract\nWe introduce Docling , an easy-to-use, self-contained, MITlicensed, open-source toolkit for document conversion, that can parse several types of popular document formats into a unified, richly structured representation. It is powered by state-of-the-art specialized AI models for layout analysis (DocLayNet) and table structure recognition (TableFormer), and runs efficiently on commodity hardware in a small resource budget. Docling is released as a Python package and can be used as a Python API or as a CLI tool. Docling's modular architecture and efficient document representation make it easy to implement extensions, new features, models, and customizations.

Among proprietary solutions, prominent examples include GPT-4o (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), and Gemini (Google). In the open-source domain, LLaVA-based models, such as LLaVA-next, are noteworthy. However, all generative AI-based models face two significant challenges. First, they are prone to hallucinations, i.e., their output may contain false information which is not present in the source document - a critical issue when faithful transcription of document content is required. Second, these models demand substantial computational resources, making the conversion process expensive. Consequently, VLM-based tools are typically offered as SaaS, with compute-intensive operations performed remotely in the cloud.\nA second category of solutions prioritizes on-premises deployment, either as Web APIs or as libraries. Examples include Adobe Acrobat, Grobid, Marker, MinerU, Unstructured, and others. These solutions often rely on multiple specialized models, such as OCR, layout analysis, and table recognition models. Docling falls into this category, leveraging modular, task-specific models which recover document structures and features only. All text content is taken from the programmatic PDF or transcribed through OCR methods. This design ensures faithful conversion, without the risk of generating false content. However, it necessitates maintaining a diverse set of models for different document components, such as formulas or figures.", "[Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion]\n1 Introduction\nConverting documents back into a unified machineprocessable format has been a major challenge for decades due to their huge variability in formats, weak standardization and printing-optimized characteristic, which often discards structural features and metadata. With the advent of LLMs and popular application patterns such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), leveraging the rich content embedded in PDFs, Office documents, and scanned document images has become ever more relevant. In the past decade, several powerful document understanding solutions have emerged on the market, most of which are commercial software, SaaS offerings on hyperscalers (Auer et al. 2022) and most recently, multimodal vision-language models. Typically, they incur a cost (e.g., for licensing or LLM inference) and cannot be run easily on local hardware. Meanwhile, only a handful of different open-source tools cover PDF, MS Word, MS PowerPoint, Images, or HTML conversion, leaving a significant feature and quality gap to proprietary solutions.\n* These authors contributed equally.\nCopyright © 2025, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nWith Docling , we recently open-sourced a very capable and efficient document conversion tool which builds on the powerful, specialized AI models and datasets for layout analysis and table structure recognition that we developed and presented in the recent past (Livathinos et al. 2021; Pfitzmann et al. 2022; Lysak et al. 2023). Docling is designed as a simple, self-contained Python library with permissive MIT license, running entirely locally on commodity hardware. Its code architecture allows for easy extensibility and addition of new features and models. Since its launch in July 2024, Docling has attracted considerable attention in the AI developer community and ranks top on GitHub's monthly trending repositories with more than 10,000 stars at the time of writing. On October 16, 2024, Docling reached a major milestone with version 2, introducing several new features and concepts, which we outline in this updated technical report, along with details on its architecture, conversion speed benchmarks, and comparisons to other open-source assets.\nThe following list summarizes the features currently available on Docling:", "[Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion]\nAbstract\nWe introduce Docling , an easy-to-use, self-contained, MITlicensed, open-source toolkit for document conversion, that can parse several types of popular document formats into a unified, richly structured representation. It is powered by state-of-the-art specialized AI models for layout analysis (DocLayNet) and table structure recognition (TableFormer), and runs efficiently on commodity hardware in a small resource budget. Docling is released as a Python package and can be used as a Python API or as a CLI tool. Docling's modular architecture and efficient document representation make it easy to implement extensions, new features, models, and customizations. Docling has been already integrated in other popular open-source frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, spaCy), making it a natural fit for the processing of documents and the development of high-end applications. The open-source community has fully engaged in using, promoting, and developing for Docling, which gathered 10k stars on GitHub in less than a month and was reported as the No. 1 trending repository in GitHub worldwide in November 2024.\nRepository -https://github.com/DS4SD/docling"], turns=None, additional_metadata=None), TestResult(name='test_case_56', success=False, metrics_data=[MetricData(name='Contextual Precision', threshold=0.5, success=False, score=0.0, reason="The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval contexts are irrelevant to the input query.
