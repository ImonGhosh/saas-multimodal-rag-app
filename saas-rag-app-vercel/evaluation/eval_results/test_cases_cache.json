      "[Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion]\n1 Introduction\nConverting documents back into a unified machineprocessable format has been a major challenge for decades due to their huge variability in formats, weak standardization and printing-optimized characteristic, which often discards structural features and metadata. With the advent of LLMs and popular application patterns such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), leveraging the rich content embedded in PDFs, Office documents, and scanned document images has become ever more relevant. In the past decade, several powerful document understanding solutions have emerged on the market, most of which are commercial software, SaaS offerings on hyperscalers (Auer et al. 2022) and most recently, multimodal vision-language models. Typically, they incur a cost (e.g., for licensing or LLM inference) and cannot be run easily on local hardware. Meanwhile, only a handful of different open-source tools cover PDF, MS Word, MS PowerPoint, Images, or HTML conversion, leaving a significant feature and quality gap to proprietary solutions.\n* These authors contributed equally.\nCopyright \u00a9 2025, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nWith Docling , we recently open-sourced a very capable and efficient document conversion tool which builds on the powerful, specialized AI models and datasets for layout analysis and table structure recognition that we developed and presented in the recent past (Livathinos et al. 2021; Pfitzmann et al. 2022; Lysak et al. 2023). Docling is designed as a simple, self-contained Python library with permissive MIT license, running entirely locally on commodity hardware. Its code architecture allows for easy extensibility and addition of new features and models. Since its launch in July 2024, Docling has attracted considerable attention in the AI developer community and ranks top on GitHub's monthly trending repositories with more than 10,000 stars at the time of writing. On October 16, 2024, Docling reached a major milestone with version 2, introducing several new features and concepts, which we outline in this updated technical report, along with details on its architecture, conversion speed benchmarks, and comparisons to other open-source assets.\nThe following list summarizes the features currently available on Docling:",
      "[Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion]\n1 Introduction\n- Parses common document formats (PDF, Images, MS Office formats, HTML) and exports to Markdown, JSON, and HTML.\n- Applies advanced AI for document understanding, including detailed page layout, OCR, reading order, figure extraction, and table structure recognition.\n- Establishes a unified DoclingDocument data model for rich document representation and operations.\n- Provides fully local execution capabilities making it suitable for sensitive data and air-gapped environments.\n- Has an ecosystem of plug-and-play integrations with prominent generative AI development frameworks, including LangChain and LlamaIndex.\n- Can leverage hardware accelerators such as GPUs.",
      "[Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion]\nAbstract\nWe introduce Docling , an easy-to-use, self-contained, MITlicensed, open-source toolkit for document conversion, that can parse several types of popular document formats into a unified, richly structured representation. It is powered by state-of-the-art specialized AI models for layout analysis (DocLayNet) and table structure recognition (TableFormer), and runs efficiently on commodity hardware in a small resource budget. Docling is released as a Python package and can be used as a Python API or as a CLI tool. Docling's modular architecture and efficient document representation make it easy to implement extensions, new features, models, and customizations. Docling has been already integrated in other popular open-source frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, spaCy), making it a natural fit for the processing of documents and the development of high-end applications. The open-source community has fully engaged in using, promoting, and developing for Docling, which gathered 10k stars on GitHub in less than a month and was reported as the No. 1 trending repository in GitHub worldwide in November 2024.\nRepository -https://github.com/DS4SD/docling"

Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n1. **Question Recognition**: Adaptive RAG first identifies the nature of the question\u2014whether it is simple, complex, broad, or narrow. This classification helps in determining the appropriate retrieval strategy.\n\n2. **Dynamic Retrieval Process**: Based on the recognized question type, Adaptive RAG modifies its retrieval process. For instance, it may choose to retrieve multiple sources of information for complex questions or focus on a single source for straightforward queries.\n\n3. **Answer Generation**: After retrieving the relevant information, Adaptive RAG generates an answer that is tailored to the specific context of the question. This may involve refining the retrieved data or synthesizing information from multiple sources.\n\n4. **Learning Over Time**: One of the key advantages of Adaptive RAG is its ability to learn from interactions. It improves its performance by adapting to user preferences and the types of queries it encounters, which enhances the relevance and accuracy of its responses over time.\n\n### Pros and Cons\n- **Pros**:\n  - Learns and improves with use, enhancing user experience.\n  - Adjusts retrieval and generation strategies based on query complexity.\n  - Balances speed and depth of responses.\n\n- **Cons**:\n  - Initial results may be inconsistent as it learns.\n  - More complex to implement and maintain compared to static RAG systems.\n  - Risk of developing biases if it learns from poor examples.\n\nAdaptive RAG is particularly useful in applications like customer support bots, research tools, and digital assistants, where a wide variety of queries are expected (Source: 14 types of RAG).",

    "actual_output": "Different types of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures exist to cater to various tasks and complexities in information retrieval and response generation. Here are some key reasons for the diversity in RAG architectures:\n\n1. **Complexity of Tasks**: Some RAG architectures are designed for simple tasks where a single retrieval and generation step suffices, while others involve multiple steps, such as retrieving, refining, and re-generating responses to enhance accuracy and relevance.\n\n2. **Use Cases**: Different applications may require specific functionalities. For instance, some architectures may be optimized for real-time data retrieval, while others might focus on integrating memory or handling multimodal inputs (text, images, etc.).\n\n3. **Performance Optimization**: Various RAG types allow for optimization in different areas, such as speed, accuracy, or resource efficiency. This flexibility enables developers to choose an architecture that best fits their performance needs.\n\n4. **Modularity**: Some RAG architectures are modular, allowing components to be upgraded or replaced independently. This is beneficial for adapting to new requirements without overhauling the entire system.\n\n5. **Innovative Approaches**: Newer architectures, like HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embedding) or Agentic RAG, introduce innovative methods for handling information retrieval and generation, reflecting ongoing research and development in the field.\n\nOverall, the variety in RAG architectures allows for tailored solutions that can address specific challenges in AI-driven information retrieval and response generation. \n\nFor a detailed overview of the different types of RAG architectures, you can refer to the source document [here](https://www.meilisearch.com/blog/14-types-of-rag).",

      "[Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion]\n1 Introduction\nConverting documents back into a unified machineprocessable format has been a major challenge for decades due to their huge variability in formats, weak standardization and printing-optimized characteristic, which often discards structural features and metadata. With the advent of LLMs and popular application patterns such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), leveraging the rich content embedded in PDFs, Office documents, and scanned document images has become ever more relevant. In the past decade, several powerful document understanding solutions have emerged on the market, most of which are commercial software, SaaS offerings on hyperscalers (Auer et al. 2022) and most recently, multimodal vision-language models. Typically, they incur a cost (e.g., for licensing or LLM inference) and cannot be run easily on local hardware.

    "actual_output": "Converting documents into a unified machine-processable format has been challenging for several reasons:\n\n1. **Diversity of Formats**: Documents come in a wide variety of formats (e.g., PDFs, Word documents, images) with different structures and characteristics. This variability complicates the development of a one-size-fits-all solution for conversion.\n\n2. **Weak Standardization**: There is a lack of strong standards governing document formats, which leads to inconsistencies in how information is encoded and presented. This inconsistency makes it difficult to create tools that can reliably process all types of documents.\n\n3. **Loss of Structural Features**: Many document formats are optimized for printing rather than for machine processing. This often results in the loss of important structural features and metadata during the conversion process, which can hinder accurate data extraction and representation.\n\n4. **Computational Resource Requirements**: Advanced document conversion tools, especially those using AI and machine learning, often require significant computational resources. This can make them expensive to operate and limit their accessibility, particularly for local deployment.\n\n5. **Quality and Accuracy Issues**: Tools that utilize generative AI models can produce outputs that include inaccuracies or \"hallucinations,\" where the generated content does not accurately reflect the source document. This is particularly problematic when precise transcription is necessary.\n\n6. **Need for Specialized Models**: Effective document conversion often requires multiple specialized models (e.g., for optical character recognition, layout analysis, and table recognition). Maintaining and integrating these diverse models adds complexity to the conversion process.\n\nThese challenges highlight the ongoing need for improved tools and methodologies in the field of document conversion, as well as the importance of developing solutions that can handle the complexities of various document types effectively (Source: Docling: An Efficient Open-Source Toolkit for AI-driven Document Conversion).",
