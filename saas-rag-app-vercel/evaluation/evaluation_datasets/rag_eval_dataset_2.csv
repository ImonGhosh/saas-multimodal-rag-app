1,"In the System Overview section, how is the NeuralFlow AI platform described, and what architecture principles are listed?","It is described as a comprehensive, cloud-native AI automation system designed for enterprise-scale deployments, prioritizing scalability, reliability, security, and maintainability while enabling rapid development and deployment of AI-powered solutions. Architecture principles: Microservices-based for independent scaling and deployment; Event-driven communication for loose coupling; Multi-tenant with data isolation; Cloud-agnostic design with provider abstraction; API-first approach for all services."
2,"In the High-Level Architecture section, what are the three main columns in the described table and what is the table's visual style?","The three main columns are Client Layer, Web Application, and Mobile Apps; the table has a white background with black text, and each column has a corresponding label and value."
3,"In the High-Level Architecture section image description, what are the two column labels and what marker appears on the first row?","The columns are labeled Model Registry and Training Pipeline, and a red dot is placed on the first row of the table."
4,"What does the API Gateway handle according to the Core Components section?","It serves as the single entry point for all client requests and handles authentication, rate limiting, request validation, and routing to appropriate microservices."
5,"Which document formats does the Document Processing Service support?","PDF, DOCX, images, and scanned documents."
6,"What compliance-related features must all conversational AI implementations include?","Content filtering, PII detection, and conversation logging."
7,"In the RAG pipeline, what is the chunking size range and which embedding model is used for embedding generation?","Chunking uses 500-1000 tokens and embedding generation uses text-embedding-ada-002."
8,"What backend technologies are listed in the Technology Stack section?","Python 3.11, FastAPI, and Celery."
9,"In the Document Processing Flow table, what are the action, output, and average time for Step 4?","Step 4 is OCR (if needed), the output is Recognized Text, and the average time is 5-15s."
10,"In the Security Layers table, what encryption mechanisms are used for data?","AES-256 at rest and TLS 1.3 in transit."
11,"In the caching strategy, what is the TTL and invalidation method for CDN static assets?","TTL is 24 hours and invalidation is version-based."
12,"What key metrics are tracked under Monitoring & Observability?","Golden Signals: Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation; Business Metrics: API usage, model accuracy, processing throughput; Infrastructure: CPU, memory, disk I/O, network bandwidth."
13,"In the Backup Strategy table, what are the backup frequency, retention, RTO, and RPO for the production database?","Frequency is continuous, retention is 30 days, RTO is < 1 hour, and RPO is < 5 min."
14,"In the Production Deployment stage, what percentage of traffic is used for the canary deployment and how long are metrics monitored?","Canary deployment uses 5% traffic and metrics are monitored for 15 minutes."
15,"Which API endpoint is listed as not requiring authentication, and what is its method and purpose?","/v1/health, GET, system health check."
